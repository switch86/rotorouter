                        <h1>About Me</h1>
                        <p>I grew up in the Bay Area and have only known the Bay to be my home. I have been a Massage Therapist since 2017 from McKinnon Body Center Therapy in Oakland. I value continuing education, keeping up with new studies in my field and learning latest in body care.</p>
                        <p>
                        My goal is to create a warm welcoming space and understand what my client's needs are through collaborative dialogue and client feedback. Utilizing my skills to find the best session plan whether through movement or touch, to get the best outcome for my clients.
                        </p>   
                        <p>
                        Becoming a Body worker and Movement teacher has a been journey, I have dealt with chronic pain and heavy life circumstances. As a result, I needed a moment of peace in my mind, body and spirit. I then discovered Massage therapy, Lymph Drainage, Pilates and Reiki, each one showed me different aspects of healing. There are multiple ways to heal, improve, care and support ourselves. We are all on a journey together and I am here to guide you as best I can.</p>
